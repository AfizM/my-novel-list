              On the way to a company workshop, we fell into a world of immortal
              cultivators while still in the car. Those with spiritual roots and
              unique abilities were all called to join cultivation sects, living
              prosperously. But I, having neither spiritual roots nor special
              abilities, lived as an ordinary mortal for 50 years, complying
              with fate until my death. Thatâ€™s what I thought. Until I
              regressed.

              emotional connections to others. This is the same as stabbing
              yourself to feel something, the worst part is that the author
              claims, he acknowledges this, the character itself doesn't. By the
